            <h4>Fundamental Programming Concepts:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Variable:</strong> A designated area in computer memory for storing data. It has a unique name to reference and modify the stored information (e.g., age = 30, name = "Alice").
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Type:</strong> Specifies the kind of data a variable will hold, informing the computer how to manage that data appropriately (e.g., Integer for whole numbers, String for text, Boolean for true/false values).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Operator:</strong> Symbols used to perform operations on data or variables (e.g., + for addition, = for assignment, == for comparison).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Function:</strong> A block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can be reused multiple times, often takes input values (Arguments), and may return a result (Return Value) (e.g., calculate_sum(a, b)).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Conditional Statement:</strong> Controls the program's flow based on a condition, such as if-else or switch-case.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loop:</strong> An instruction that causes a block of code to repeat multiple times until a condition is met or a specified number of iterations is completed (e.g., for loop, while loop).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Comment:</strong> Text within the code written by programmers to explain its functionality. Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and do not affect program execution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Input/Output (I/O):</strong> The process of receiving data into the program (Input) and displaying or sending data out of the program (Output).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Error Handling:</strong> The process of catching and managing errors or exceptions that might occur during program execution, preventing unexpected crashes (e.g., try-catch, try-except).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Library / Module / Package:</strong> A collection of pre-written code, functions, or classes that programmers can reuse, saving time and effort.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope:</strong> Defines the region of a program where a variable can be accessed or used (e.g., Local Scope, Global Scope).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recursion:</strong> A programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem, breaking down a large problem into smaller, similar sub-problems.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Data Structures:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Array:</strong> A data structure that stores a collection of data items of the same type in a contiguous sequence. Each item can be accessed using an index (e.g., numbers = [10, 20, 30]).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>List:</strong> A resizable collection that can store data of any type (in some languages).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dictionary / Map:</strong> A data structure that stores data as Key-Value Pairs, allowing for fast retrieval of data via its key (e.g., student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Set:</strong> A data structure that stores a collection of unique, unordered data items. Ideal for quickly checking for membership.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tuple:</strong> A data structure that stores an ordered collection of data items that are immutable (cannot be changed) once created.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Code execution paradigms section -->
            <h4>Code Execution Paradigms:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Compilation:</strong> The process of transforming human-written Source Code into Machine Code that a computer can understand and run directly. This occurs before the program is run (e.g., C++, Java).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The process where a program directly executes instructions from the Source Code line by line while the program is running, without creating a separate machine code file (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Programming paradigms section -->
            <h4>Programming Paradigms:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain both data and code. It emphasizes program design using objects and classes (e.g., Java, C++, C#, Python).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Functional Programming (FP):</strong> A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding mutable state and side effects. It focuses on using pure functions (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Scala).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> A programming paradigm derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call. It involves writing code that follows a step-by-step, sequential order (e.g., C).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Event-Driven Programming:</strong> A paradigm where the program's execution flow is determined by events (e.g., mouse clicks, key presses, messages from other programs). It's fundamental for developing Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications and web applications.
              </li>
