          <h4>Fundamental Programming Concepts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Variable:</strong> A designated area in computer memory used to store data. It has a unique name that allows us to reference, use, or modify the stored information (e.g., age = 30, name = "Alice").
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Type:</strong> Specifies the kind of data a variable will hold, informing the computer how to manage that data (e.g., Integer for whole numbers, String for text, Boolean for true/false values).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operator:</strong> Symbols used to perform operations on data or variables (e.g., + for addition, = for assignment, == for comparison of equality).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Function:</strong> A block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can be reused multiple times, often takes input values (Arguments), and may return a result (Return Value) (e.g., calculate_sum(a, b)).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conditional Statement:</strong> Controls the program's flow based on a condition. If the condition is True, one set of instructions is executed; if False, another set is executed, or none at all (e.g., if-else, switch-case).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Loop:</strong> An instruction that causes a block of code to repeat multiple times until a specified condition is met or a certain number of repetitions is completed (e.g., for loop for a definite number of iterations, while loop for repeating until a condition becomes false).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Array:</strong> A data structure used to store a collection of data items of the same type, arranged in a sequential order. Each item can be accessed using an index (e.g., numbers = [10, 20, 30]).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comment:</strong> Text within the code written by programmers to explain how the code works. Comments are ignored by the compiler or interpreter (they help make the code more understandable for humans).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Input/Output (I/O):</strong> Handles the process of receiving data into the program (Input) from sources like a keyboard, files, or networks, and displaying data out of the program (Output) to places like the screen or saved files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Error Handling:</strong> The process of catching and managing errors or exceptions that might occur while a program is running. This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly (e.g., try-catch, try-except).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Library / Module / Package:</strong> A collection of pre-written code, functions, or classes that programmers can reuse without having to write everything from scratch (e.g., math module in Python, java.util package in Java).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scope:</strong> Defines the region of a program where a variable can be accessed or used. Variables declared inside a function have a limited scope within that function (Local Scope), while variables declared outside functions can be accessed from any part of the program (Global Scope).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recursion:</strong> A programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem. It breaks down a large problem into smaller, similar sub-problems until a basic condition is reached that can be solved directly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Code Execution Paradigms:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Compilation:</strong> The process of transforming human-written Source Code into Machine Code that a computer can understand and run directly. This process occurs before the program is run (e.g., C++, Java).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The process where a program directly executes instructions from the source code line by line without creating a separate machine code file. Interpretation happens while the program is running (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Paradigms:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code. It emphasizes program design using objects and classes (e.g., Java, C++, C#, Python).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functional Programming (FP):</strong> A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It focuses on writing code using pure functions and avoiding side effects (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Scala).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> A programming paradigm derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call. It involves writing code that follows a step-by-step, sequential order (e.g., C).
            </li>
          </ul>
